1. Loan project - p1, p2, p3 on development. p4 on deployment.
   p5 with end-to-end production pipeline. simulate real-time data incoming from 70% unused data.
   then use previously built model to simulate its production with e.g. 100 daily requests.
   retrain the model monthly via a pipeline. shoe daily performance dashboard.
   try to build a pipeline as a kf pipeline for (re)training and a dataflow pipeline for preprocessing.
2. spg_stocks. similar to loans p5, but with fully real-world data.
(3). flights, full vertex pipeline. probably not an article, just some learning project.
4. comparison btw automl, bqml and manual modeling on some simple example.
   p1: compare performance, cost and dev time. p2: compare the same metrics in production.
