real-time data and Vertex AI pipeline, which follows GCP best practices.
should implement this thing first and then use it to modify spg_stocks.

before implementing stuff from AI in practice, do this:

coursera Production ML Systems Week 1 has a great example of productionalizing natality model.
the only problem is that is is built in Patform AI. Will have to figure out how to migrate that to Vertex AI.
Have used its frontend, works fine. its webpage looks nicer plus allows to use difefrent data types.
See loan project.
Have not implemented loose coupling of webapp with model api from vertex endpoint yet.
